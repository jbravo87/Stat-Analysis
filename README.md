### Judge Voting

I found this article from FiveThirtyEight about [Judge Gorsuch's Record.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-a-trump-nominee-neil-gorsuchs-record-is-surprisingly-moderate-on-immigration/) This data set was chosen because of the binary nature of voting. Judges vote either conservative or liberal.
This allows for use of classification methods to perform statistical analysis. Specifically, the use of Logistic Regression while be invoked.
